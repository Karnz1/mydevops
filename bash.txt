Controlling Filename Expansion
There are several settings for the builtin shopt command that control how filename expansion operates. A couple of interesting ones are:

shopt -s nocaseglob -- perform case insensitive matching
shopt -s extglob -- enable extended patterns
shopt -s nullglob -- if no files match, replace the pattern with nothing. The default behaviour is to leave the pattern in place as a literal string.


Some important parameters used by or set by bash include:

PATH -- a colon-separated list of directories used to find external commands.
IFS -- the "internal field separator". We'll see how it's used below.
PWD -- your current working directory. It will be the same value as the output of the pwd command.
RANDOM -- a pseudo-random integer between 0 and 32767.
BASH_VERSION -- the version string of the running instance of bash.
